  * ##### 0.5.0
    * very usable in it's original form
    * ran on my desktop non-stop for it's lifetime
    * until it was replaced by the inprogress up-versioning
  * ##### 0.6.0 20210611.0040
    * alarms are properly tripped (singles)
    * intervals seem to process fine, including CURRENT_INTERVAL_COUNT
    * has run on my desktop nonstop for maybe a week
    * creeping above usable toward acceptably usable
  * ##### 0.7.0 20210620.1500
    * alarms now properly flash name and interval count in the "flippable" items
    * progress toward more standard code style
    * started adding docstrings
    * alarms are triggered properly, popups will be done after code is all commented etc. since that will only get more difficult the longer I put it off
    * modifiable layout implemented
    * fully usable minus popups
