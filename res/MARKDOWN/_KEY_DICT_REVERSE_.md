# \_KEY_DICT_REVERSE\_

  * holds all of the PySimpleGUI key to standard key entries
- key is the _USE_THIS_KEY_ sg way of knowing the element (usually text elements)
- value is the standardized keys that hoomans use in all of their code
- if the element does not require, as text elements do do, that each use of the element definition requires a new key, called _USE_THIS_KEY_ in the code, then both key and value will be the standard keys used, any elements that require this outright will be automatically generated by FM*.py as the variables are assembled
- there is the ability to add a translation of your own, both are expected to be values rather than strings FMAXPSG_SCTN09FF_CLASS_INIT_ADD2_FOREIGN_KEY action does that for you from TBGLST
