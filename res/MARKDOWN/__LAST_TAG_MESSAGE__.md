### known issues solved, features added, etc.
  * clock works flawlessly
  * elapsed timer works appropriately
  * countdown to next event works flawlessly
  * converted to a more standard coding style rather than my personal style from multiple languages past and present, and my way to stay sane in those conditions ;P 
  * started on documentation
  * started autodocumenting preparations as far as the classes go, in parseTBGLST
  * 

### known issues:
  * no popups yet, that's up next
  * considering adding days up to 99|999 
  * runaway is not functional for no apparent reason, hoping to add to my knowledge about that by spending a few minutes working on new functionality instead
