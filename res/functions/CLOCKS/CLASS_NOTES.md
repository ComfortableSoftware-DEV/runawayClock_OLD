# CLASS NOTES

## _KEY_DICT_REVERSE_

  * holds all of the PySimpleGUI key to standard key entries
- key is the _USE_THIS_KEY_ sg way of knowing the element (usually text elements)
- value is the standardized keys that hoomans use in all of their code
- if the element does not require, as text elements do do, that each use of the element definition requires a new key, called _USE_THIS_KEY_ in the code, then both key and value will be the standard keys used, any elements that require this outright will be automatically generated by FM*.py as the variables are assembled
- there is the ability to add a translation of your own, both are expected to be values rather than strings FMAXPSG_SCTN09FF_CLASS_INIT_ADD2_FOREIGN_KEY action does that for you from TBGLST
-


## _THIS_KEY_BASE_

  * the text submitted from outside which is used to make sure that PySimpleGUI has ample keys available for often reused text elements
- K_STANDARD_KEY is the key everywhere except PySimpleGUI (K_STANDARD_KEY is an example, any defined key (FMAXPSG_SCTN0900_KEY_DEF, "__key__") works)
- _USE_THIS_KEY_(K_STANDARD_KEY) returns (K_STANDARD_KEY + keybase_/_THIS_KEY_BASE_) as the PySimpleGUI safe key for those elements which require such
- this is set in TBGLST when elements are defined which require them, the far left bool just before the comment
- ### code line in TBGLST setting up a foreign key, this is the whole line broken down and commented
- 	("PSGVAL__CLOCKS_FUNC_00_INIT03_KEY01", FMAXPSG_SCTN09FF_CLASS_INIT_ADD2_FOREIGN_KEY, "CLOCKS", "K_CHECKBOX_ALPHA_DIM", "K_CHECKBOX_ALPHA_DIM", "False", "add foreign key for alpha dimming",),
-  * ("PSGVAL__CLOCKS_FUNC_00_INIT03_KEY01",
-  *  * [useless] name used to keep everything straight in TBGLST
-  * FMAXPSG_SCTN09FF_CLASS_INIT_ADD2_FOREIGN_KEY, 	 
-  * "CLOCKS",
-  * "K_CHECKBOX_ALPHA_DIM",
-  * "K_CHECKBOX_ALPHA_DIM",
-  * "bool is reverse entry capable using _USE_THIS_KEY_",
-  * "add foreign key for alpha dimming",),
-   *  * [useless] name used internally
